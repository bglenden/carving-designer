# File Sub-buttons Test Instructions

## What was fixed:
1. **File button visual state**: File button now turns blue when submenu is open
2. **Button state management**: File button properly indicates when submenu is active
3. **Error handling**: Added proper error handling for missing callbacks
4. **UI consistency**: File button behavior now matches other toolbar buttons

## How to test:

### 1. Open the application
- Open `public/index.html` in your browser
- Or run a local server and navigate to the application

### 2. Test File button visual state
- Click the "F" (File) button in the toolbar
- **Expected**: Button should turn blue when clicked and submenu opens
- **Expected**: Button should return to gray when submenu closes

### 3. Test sub-buttons functionality
- Click the File button to open submenu
- Try each sub-button:
  - **Load**: Should open file picker dialog for .json files
  - **Save**: Should download current design as JSON file
  - **Save As**: Should prompt for filename and download JSON file

### 4. Test menu closing
- Menu should close when:
  - Clicking a sub-button
  - Clicking outside the menu
  - Clicking the File button again
  - Switching to other modes (Edit, Background, etc.)

### 5. Check browser console
- Open browser dev tools (F12) â†’ Console
- Should see no errors when clicking buttons
- Should see warnings only if callbacks aren't set (which shouldn't happen)

## If buttons still don't work:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify all files are properly served (no 404 errors)
3. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Clear browser cache

## File format improvements:
- Saved files now include metadata (creation date, description)
- Schema validation ensures file compatibility
- Better error messages for invalid files
