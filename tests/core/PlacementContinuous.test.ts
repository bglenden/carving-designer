/**
 * Test for continuous placement functionality
 * 
 * Issue: In placement mode, after placing a shape, the placement mode would
 * automatically exit, forcing users to re-enable placement mode for each shape.
 * 
 * Fix: Modified PlacementManager.completePlacement() to stay in PLACING_POINTS
 * state after successfully placing a shape, allowing continuous placement.

    // This test serves as documentation of the expected behavior:
    // 1. User enters placement mode for a shape type (e.g., LEAF)
    // 2. User places first shape by clicking required points
    // 3. Shape is created and added to canvas
    // 4. Placement mode remains active for the same shape type
    // 5. User can immediately place another shape without re-entering placement mode
    // 6. This continues until user explicitly exits placement mode (ESC, cancel, or mode change)
    
    // The fix is in PlacementManager.completePlacement():
    // - After successful shape creation, reset points array
    // - Transition from PLACED back to PLACING_POINTS state
    // - Maintain the current shapeType
    
    expect(true).toBe(true); // Placeholder assertion
